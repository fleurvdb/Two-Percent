      <h2 style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4" style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;"><br><b>What the campaign is about</b></br> 

Our campaign is about empowering individuals and helping them practice self love and acceptance while at the same time encouraging them to become part of our community to create a safe space for individuals that feel like they don’t belong and need to adjust themselves to fit into society. <br>

<br><b>What the message is</b></br>  

Our message is that everybody is needed for the society to be complete, even this last 1% that people often tend to forget doesn’t feel included. <br>

<br><b>Which promotional activities were executed</b></br>

Our promotional activities consisted of empowering messages, posts of ourselves and a contest. 
We tried to use the empowering messages to boost the confidence of our followers while they are on a platform that confronts them with not being society’s standard. 
The post of ourselves were used to give the followers a face that is connected with the brand and make our brand more personal in that way. 
We decided to use a contest to get more engagement with our followers and give them the push to start expressing themselves without being scared. 
chosen channels/platforms used are explained and justified 

We decided to use Instagram since that is the platform that got mentioned in all of our interviews and it has the widest range within our target group possible.  </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4" style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Learning Points</h4>
      <p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;"><b>What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign?</b> <br>
        <i>Based on our experience:</i> <br>
        - Advertisement are important to gain more reach. <br>
        - A proper and fully written out planning is fundamental part of reaching goals. <br>
        - Posting frequently creates a stronger bond with the followers. And it makes it easier for the client to relate and feel as part of the community. </p>
      <p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;"><b>What worked and what didn’t?</b><br> <i>Continue</i><br> - Using Instagram as a main source of reaching our target audience. <br>- Engaging with our customers and supporting them. To share stories and experiences with our customers. <br>- Posting content that makes our target audience feel part of our community. &nbsp;
  <br> <br> <i>Change</i> <br>

- Start trying out different social media.  

To reach more specific parts of our target group (such as specific age, minority or gender) <br>

- Posting more periodically. 

 To gain more engagement with our customers, we need to post more frequently and on specific time when users are using the particular platform. <br>

- Use Planable, 

 To have a better structured and clearer overview of our planning. <br> <br>
<b>What went as expected and what didn’t? </b> <br>

<i>Expectation:</i> <br>

- At the beginning we expected to not reach a lot of people. <br>

- We expected that our promotional posts will be ambiguous due to us not actually creating the physical perfume. <br>

- We expected that our target audience will feel safe, and they are going to not feel pressured to be someone else. <br> <br>

 

<i>Unanticipated: </i> <br>

- A low budget is still enough to reach the desired audience. <br>

- People engaging with our social media was harder than expected. <br>

- Coming up with creative posts and posting them at a good time in order for it to reach our target audience. <br>
<br><b>What would you do differently? </b> <br>
In the future, when creating a brand, we are going to focus more on interacting with our customers by creating polls, asking the customers to share their experience. <br> <br>
<b>Reflect on the past work and describe what you learned. </b> <br>
 Generally, while we were working on the campaign, we came to the conclusion that planning and commitment is vital. As well as having a devoted following base that wants to engage with our social media. We learned that managing only one social media is harder than expected.

<h4 class="mt-4" style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Future Planning</h4>
      <p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;"> As discussed in the Lean Canvas we only focused on Instagram during this project due to us wanting to make our social media account be a safe space for everyone who feels out of place or alone in society. We wanted our customers to be themselves and always be exactly who they are. If the project continued, we would have liked to also use other social media platforms to promote our brand, we are going to do more interviews with people who are part of minority groups and discuss with them what social media platform do they feel safest while using. Additionally, we will focus more on the advertising of our brand on social media. We realized just how important advertisement is for a social media campaign. Thirdly, we learned that planning is also a key factor in creating a good campaign. That is why if we continue with our brand, we will focus more on planning by using additional programmes such as Planable. Future recommendations for our brand will be to create reels because we found out that they reach broader audience. Additionally, we also believe that asking our followers about our content, recommendations and just having discussion with them will be a valuable attribute in creating a closer bond with our customers. </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4" style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Professionalism</h4>
